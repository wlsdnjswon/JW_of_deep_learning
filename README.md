# J Deep Learning

Welcome to **J Deep Learning**! This repository serves as a collection of deep learning projects, implementations of research papers, and various techniques that contribute to solving complex machine learning problems. The content here is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing both researchers and practitioners to explore, learn, and contribute.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The repository is split into two main sections:

1. **[Deep Learning Papers Implementation](./Deep_Learning_Papers_Implementation)**: Reproducing state-of-the-art deep learning research papers.
2. **[Deep Learning Techniques](./Deep_Learning_Techniques)**: Implementing various fundamental and advanced techniques for tasks such as classification and segmentation.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
J_deep_learning/
├── Deep_Learning_Papers_Implementation/
│   └── Classification_Ensemble/

    ├── Classification_SignLanguageMNIST/
    ├── SemanticSegmentation_ColorImage_Binary/
    └── SemanticSegmentation_ColorImage_Multiclass/
```

Each sub-folder contains code implementations, model weights, and data used in the respective projects.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/J_deep_learning.git
cd J_deep_learning
```

Explore the folders to find implementations and training scripts for different deep learning tasks. Each directory contains its own `README.md` with detailed instructions on running the models.
